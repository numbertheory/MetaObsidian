# Better Word Count
Better word count allows you to not only see the character and word count for the open document in the status bar of the editor, which is provided by default in Obsidian, but also responds to word selections. That way you can get the word count of  single paragraph or section of a page.

When enabling this plugin, be sure to disable the default word count, so that you don't have redundant information in the status bar.
