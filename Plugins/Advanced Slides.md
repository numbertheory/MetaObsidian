# Advanced Slides
Advanced Slides is for slideshows in Obsidian. A single markdown file is used for the source of the slideshow, and the presentation is finally rendered as either a static website, a PDF, or live inside a separate browser window. When presenting, hit the `S` key to create a new pop-up window, which will act as your control window as the presenter.  The default themes have crisp animations, with the ability to make themes of your own, and override themes on specific slides with your own CSS.
