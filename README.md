## MetaObsidian

This vault shares some of the plugins I find useful in Obsidian. I am including some tools and pages to browse styles and preview the plugins I find most useful. You can also use this to see examples of plugins in action, which sometimes take a considerable amount of set up before they are very useful.

### How to use this vault
- Clone down this repo.
- Open Obsidian locally.
- Click to open a vault.
- Navigate to this cloned repo and open it.

You will have to enable the community plugins I have enabled in this vault to see all the previews.

### Articles
This table is automatically generated from the `Articles` folder:

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link AS "Name", dateformat(file.mtime, "yyyy-MM-dd, hh:mm a") AS "Last Modified" FROM "Articles"
```
